# Introduction to Algorithms and Programming Projects

This repository contains projects that I have completed for the Introduction to Algorithms and Programming course. Each project focuses on a different aspect of programming in C.

## Project List:

1. **Array Find Max**
2. **Array Odd Even**
3. **Array Separate Positive Negative**
4. **Array Sorting**
5. **Array with Matrix Average**
6. **DiceGuessingGame**
7. **Matrix Creation**
8. **Matrix Find Max**
9. **Matrix Positive Negative**
10. **Matrix Principal Diagonal**
11. **Matrix Separate Positive Negative**

## How to Run:

This repository contains beginner-level C projects developed during the "Introduction to Algorithms and Programming" course. You can access and review the source code of these projects, which were developed using Dev C++ IDE, to deepen your understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
